    <h2><u>PERSONAL STATEMENT</u></h2>
    <p>I have always had this dream to become a more relevant person when it comes to technological advancements. Due to this passion for technology and its effect on the now society, I decided to get a degree in Computer Engineering and develop technological things that will also have great impact on society. I have developed the skills of coding in more than four programming languages. Also developed a skill to detect and fix bugs in programs that has vivid documentation on which method its developers used. I have also develop a skill to know how technology that are yet to be developed and already developed would work and with the help of a team, we would successfully develop the program with less bugs.</p>

    <h2><u>INTEREST AND ACHIEVEMENT</u></h2>
    <p>I fancy technological machines. Due to this, during my level 200 end of 1<sup>st</sup>  semester project, my team and I were able to develop an <em><strong>online attendance system application for both web and mobile</strong></em>, to help take away the stress on teaching assistants when it comes to attendance taking. That same semester we developed an <em>unbiased electronic dice.</em></p>
