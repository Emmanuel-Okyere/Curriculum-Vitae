    <h2><u>INTEREST AND ACHIEVEMENT</u></h2>
    <p>I fancy technological machines. Due to this, during my level 200 end of 1<sup>st</sup>  semester project, my team and I were able to develop an <em><strong>online attendance system application for both web and mobile</strong></em>, to help take away the stress on teaching assistants when it comes to attendance taking. That same semester we developed an <em>unbiased electronic dice.</em></p>
